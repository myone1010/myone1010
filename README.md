Hello, this is Myone.
I love program development and am especially talented at front-end development.
I have over 6 years of experience as a front-end developer.
I have managed many orders from customers with diverse needs and have been happy to be able to satisfy them.
When it comes to managing my work, being on time is always the most important thing to me, so I have never stayed up late to get work done.
This is because the first element of credit collateral is time.
